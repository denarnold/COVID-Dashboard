# COVID-Dashboard

I created this dashboard early on in the pandemic in order to easily compare case counts between a handful of counties where family members resided. The dashboard is built using R and Shiny, and case records are pulled live from the Johns Hopkins Data Repository.

The dashboard is hosted live at https://dennisarnold.shinyapps.io/COVID_Dashboard/
